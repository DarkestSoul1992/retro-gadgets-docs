# Contributing
## 1. How to contribute a theme?
  If you want to contribute a theme, you will need to go to <a href="https://github.com/kurmachu/retro-docs-site" target="_blank">Kurmachu's viewer GitHub</a> and fork it into your GitHub account.
   After forking it and having your theme coded (you can use the <a href="https://github.com/kurmachu/retro-docs-site/blob/master/themes/default/arithm.css" target="_blank">Arithm</a> default theme), you are going to the "themes" folder (in your repo), open it, go into the classification that you consider that is perfect for your theme (For example, the Darkshell theme goes into the "dark" classification because uses a lot of dark color), upload it and commit it into the repo. After that, go into the "contribute" button, click the "Open Pull Request" button and fill the information that asks you.
## 2. How to contribute helping with the Website or with a bug fixing?
  For helping with the Website (not just the themes), like improving descriptions, adding examples, and writing guides. You will fork the original repo (<a href="https://github.com/NexTre-dev/retro-gadgets-docs" target="_blank">Nextre-dev repo</a>) change the thing you think that need to be changed, and open a Pull Request filling the info.
